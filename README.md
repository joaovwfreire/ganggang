# NonFungibleGang DAO Factory Smart Contract (NFGDAOFactory)

## Overview
Non-Fungible Gang's DAO Factory for creating new DAOs using the AtomicAssets non-fungible token standard. This contract works on EOS and it's forks(like Telos, Worbli, etc) - and of course, WAX.
It is an easy way to create a DAO with a custom Non-Fungible Token (NFT) asset and distribute Fungible Tokens (FT) to the DAO members.
The DAO members can vote on proposals and the proposals can be executed by the DAO members.
The DAO governors can also create new proposals and execute them.
The DAO main account is the account that created the DAO and we intend to create a guide on how to make this account a multisig account.

New members can join the DAO by buying the DAO NFT asset from the AtomicMarketplace and staking the NFT asset to the DAO main account by accessing
the DAO dashboard at dao.nonfungiblegang.com.
